## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project required me to work with CSS tooltips and add/remove content with Javascript. I again leveraged flexbox for the layout. In this project, I was conscientious to only use em or percent-based units as I had more time available to sit with this project. I picked this project because I thought it would be a quick layout to tackle, although I did get sidetracked by needing to find and work with SVG icons rather than the images provided.

### Continued development

For the desktop view, I attempted to use CSS Grid, however, I was not able to get the image to be the same height as the content next to it despite multiple attempts. I will have to do more research into what exactly went wrong as I thought that would be a perfect use for grid layout. 

### Useful resources

- [https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_tooltip.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_tooltip.asp) - I followed this to understand the concept behind tool tips. Also leveraged the bottom arrow with some modifications.
